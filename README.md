Welcome to the You Know the Works Company assignment! This website serves as a straightforward resume that presents personal information, work experience, and awards. It has been designed to be responsive, so it can be accessed on any device, whether it's a mobile phone, tablet, or laptop.

To create this website, I used a combination of HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. These technologies were employed to ensure that the website is visually appealing, easy to navigate, and functional.
